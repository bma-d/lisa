# Breadcrumbs 2026-02-24

- **02:53:17**: Feature cluster C implementation
  Added session turn orchestration command, session state-sandbox snapshot/restore/clear/list command, smoke --contract-profile full matrix checks, and targeted tests for new behavior.
- **02:53:22**: Context sync review
  Reviewed .agents postflight scope; no context file edits applied in this task to keep change scope limited to command/smoke/test implementation files.
- **03:11:29**: Implement Lisa feature clusters + contract sync
  Integrated session turn/state-sandbox commands, route strict typed-state support, handoff v4, monitor adaptive polling, capture strip-banner, packet delta-json, budget from-jsonl, smoke contract-profile; aligned help/capabilities/USAGE/skills docs and installed skill v5.4.0.
- **06:36:31** (`skills/lisa/SKILL.md`): Clarify strict guard exit contract
  Updated guard quick-map: strict machine policy exits 1 only when risk detected; safe contexts exit 0 with safe:true.
- **06:36:34** (`skills/lisa/data/validation.md`): Refresh validation contracts
  Validated date updated to 2026-02-24; added strict-guard safe-path behavior and session explain --events parse guard (invalid_events).
- **06:36:37** (`skills/lisa/data/commands.md`): Document explain flag parsing
  Added explicit note that --events/--recent require numeric values; bare flags return invalid_events usage error.
