# Breadcrumbs 2026-02-10

- **00:14:16**: Add multi-channel install/release pipeline
  Added GoReleaser config + CI/release workflows + README install matrix; updated module path for go install and added lisa version output for package-manager verification.
- **00:14:16**: Refresh agent context after release tooling changes
  Updated .agents/project-overview.md and .agents/conventions.md to document GoReleaser-based distribution and new root file structure.
- **00:54:11** (`src/status.go`): Fix status heuristics and cleanup reliability
  Narrowed prompt-wait detection to recent output, fixed zero-CPU process detection, and expanded artifact cleanup to remove session files across project hashes.
- **00:54:11** (`src/regressions_test.go`): Add regression coverage for fixed issues
  Added tests for prompt marker false-positives, zero-CPU process matching, cross-project artifact cleanup, and doctor JSON build metadata payload.
- **00:54:11** (`.agents/conventions.md`): Postflight context sync check
  Reviewed context files after fixes; no AGENTS/.agents updates required because changes were targeted bug fixes without new architecture or conventions.
- **01:57:48** (`src/commands_session.go`): Fix kill ordering
  session kill/kill-all now terminate tmux sessions before artifact cleanup so cleanup errors cannot leave sessions running
- **01:57:49** (`src/commands_agent.go`): Harden doctor flags
  doctor now rejects unknown flags and matches CLI flag parsing behavior
- **01:57:50** (`src/regressions_test.go`): Add regression coverage
  added tests for doctor unknown flags and kill/kill-all ordering under cleanup failures
- **02:21:40** (`src/status.go`): Harden exec completion marker detection
  parseExecCompletion now only trusts markers at pane tail and ignores stale historical markers with substantive trailing output.
- **02:21:40** (`src/commands_session.go`): Tighten CLI parsing and test seams
  session spawn now uses injectable tmux function vars for tests; monitor --stop-on-waiting now validates strict boolean values.
- **02:21:40** (`src/regressions_test.go`): Add regression coverage for found issues
  Added tests for Run(version), parseExecCompletion stale marker behavior, session spawn parsing/json path, and invalid stop-on-waiting values.
- **02:21:45**: Postflight context sync
  Reviewed .agents context after fixes; no AGENTS/.agents updates required because changes align with existing documented patterns (function-variable mocking and manual flag parsing).
- **03:51:59**: Fix review findings
  Made session status/monitor CSV-safe, cleaned artifacts on spawn send failure, switched session commands to mockable tmux function vars, added regression tests and docs updates.
- **04:06:06**: Address post-commit review findings
  Tightened exec completion prompt-tail checks to avoid false positives on trailing '>' output, made --stop-on-waiting strict true|false parsing, and added regressions for both behaviors.
- **04:35:19**: Fix status prompt heuristic and missing-session cleanup
  Prevent false waiting_input on tag-like Claude tails, preserve active status for busy agents, and run artifact cleanup even when tmux session is missing; added regression tests.
- **04:35:20**: Refresh JSON output guidance in context docs
  Updated .agents/conventions.md and .agents/project-overview.md to document exact commands that support --json vs text-only helpers.
- **04:46:14**: Fix review findings: exec wrapper, shell detection, docs wording
  Made exec wrapper resilient to errexit shells, expanded shell detection (pwsh/tcsh/etc + *sh), added regression tests, and corrected architecture wording from deterministic to unique session names.
- **04:46:18**: Postflight context sync check
  Reviewed .agents context for staleness after fixes; no AGENTS/.agents updates required because behavior changes are covered by code/tests and existing context remains accurate.
- **04:58:11** (`src/commands_session.go`): Enforce session naming contract
  session spawn now requires custom --session names to start with lisa-; added regression test coverage
- **04:58:11** (`.goreleaser.yaml`): Drop unsupported Windows release targets
  removed windows build/scoop packaging and documented macOS/Linux support in README
- **04:58:11** (`.agents/project-overview.md`): Refresh context after release/sessions changes
  updated context docs for release channels and custom session naming expectations
- **04:58:25** (`.agents/sdk-usage.md`): Update SDK context timestamp
  bumped Last Updated and documented lisa- prefix requirement for custom session names
- **05:09:49** (`src/regressions_test.go`): Add regression tests for tmux list-sessions empty-state
  Added fake-tmux PATH tests covering no-server->empty-list and unexpected stderr->error behavior.
- **05:09:49** (`src/tmux.go`): Handle empty tmux server state in list-sessions
  Treat 'no server running/no sessions' tmux output as empty list so session list/kill-all succeed with zero sessions.
- **05:10:06** (`src/.agents/tmux-layer.md`): Refresh tmux context doc for empty-session behavior
  Documented tmuxListSessions no-server/no-sessions normalization and updated Last Updated date.
- **15:00:41** (`src/session_wrapper.go`): Add session lifecycle wrapper + heartbeat
  Wrapped startup commands with __LISA_SESSION_START__/__LISA_SESSION_DONE__ markers and heartbeat file updates; status now uses heartbeat freshness and session done markers for more accurate in_progress/completed/crashed detection.
- **15:00:45** (`src/.agents/state-machine.md`): Refresh context docs for wrapper status model
  Updated src/.agents state-machine, tmux-layer, and session-lifecycle docs with heartbeat artifact/env and session wrapper markers to keep JIT context accurate.
- **15:35:47** (`src/status.go`): Implement run-id markers + heartbeat mtime observability
  Added tokenized session done parsing, mtime-based heartbeat freshness, classificationReason/signals fields, state-file locking, and per-session JSONL transition/snapshot event logging in computeSessionStatus.
- **15:35:53** (`src/commands_session_explain.go`): Add session explain diagnostics command
  Introduced 'lisa session explain' with JSON/text outputs, surfaced reason/signals/event tail, and expanded tests around marker mismatch, signal trap handling, explain payloads, and concurrent state polling.
- **17:06:58**: Hardening: lock timeout, event retention, process-scan cache
  Added bounded state lock acquisition with timeout signals; resilient event tail parsing with dropped-line counts; bounded event log trimming; process scan caching and batched pane snapshot reads; spawn now fail-fast on metadata persistence errors; split session command handlers for maintainability; added Codex E2E coverage and updated docs.
- **17:07:04**: Context sync
  Updated src/.agents/state-machine.md, session-lifecycle.md, and testing.md to reflect lock timeout fallback, bounded event logs, process scan caching, metadata fail-fast spawn semantics, and Codex E2E test coverage.
- **17:25:59**: Stability/observability hardening
  Addressed review findings: meta/state/event error signals, lock-timeout degraded state, cleanup-on-kill-failure, regex precompile, expanded tests.
- **17:26:03**: Context docs refreshed
  Updated README and AGENTS context files with degraded state and new infra observability signals.
- **17:29:04**: Follow-up hardening
  Added monitor degraded terminal handling, reduced event append trim I/O, updated docs, and added monitor degraded regression coverage.
- **18:07:18**: Hardening pass
  Added command timeouts, event-file locking/retention fixes, agent scan error signaling, starship prompt marker parsing fix, and expanded regression/integration test coverage.
- **18:07:56**: Context refresh
  Updated src/.agents docs for process-scan degraded state, command timeout behavior, event-lock retention, and new hermetic interactive integration coverage.
