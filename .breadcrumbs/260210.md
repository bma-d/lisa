# Breadcrumbs 2026-02-10

- **00:14:16**: Add multi-channel install/release pipeline
  Added GoReleaser config + CI/release workflows + README install matrix; updated module path for go install and added lisa version output for package-manager verification.
- **00:14:16**: Refresh agent context after release tooling changes
  Updated .agents/project-overview.md and .agents/conventions.md to document GoReleaser-based distribution and new root file structure.
- **00:54:11** (`src/status.go`): Fix status heuristics and cleanup reliability
  Narrowed prompt-wait detection to recent output, fixed zero-CPU process detection, and expanded artifact cleanup to remove session files across project hashes.
- **00:54:11** (`src/regressions_test.go`): Add regression coverage for fixed issues
  Added tests for prompt marker false-positives, zero-CPU process matching, cross-project artifact cleanup, and doctor JSON build metadata payload.
- **00:54:11** (`.agents/conventions.md`): Postflight context sync check
  Reviewed context files after fixes; no AGENTS/.agents updates required because changes were targeted bug fixes without new architecture or conventions.
