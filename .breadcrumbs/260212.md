- **09:34:50**: Add transcript-based turn completion signal
  New checkTranscriptTurnComplete function in claude_session.go reads tail of Claude JSONL transcript to detect when an assistant turn has completed (last meaningful entry is assistant with text block and file is stale >3s). Integrated into status.go classification switch between interactiveWaiting and promptWaiting. Session ID cached in sessionState to avoid re-scanning history.jsonl. New signals: TranscriptTurnComplete, TranscriptFileAge, TranscriptError in statusSignals. 5 unit tests + 2 regression tests added.
