- **02:33:38**: Fix primary lisa findings
  Added interactive shell waiting_input classification with pane-tree inspection (ignoring passive sleep helpers), added session exists --project-root support, and added session capture --strip-noise filtering for Codex/MCP startup noise. Updated tests and usage/help docs; go test ./... passes.
- **02:33:39**: Refresh context docs
  Updated src/.agents/state-machine.md and .agents/sdk-usage.md to document interactive_shell_idle classification, passive sleep handling, capture --strip-noise, and exists --project-root support.
- **02:55:59**: Flip capture noise default
  Changed session capture to filter Codex/MCP startup noise by default; added --keep-noise opt-out (kept --strip-noise as compatibility alias), updated help/USAGE/SDK docs, and added tests for default-strip and keep-noise behavior.
