- **05:21:21**: Fix packet cursor interop + handoff schema guidance
  Added packet cursor compatibility across json-min/delta-json modes, aligned handoff_v2_required guidance to v2|v3|v4, added focused regressions and rebuilt ./lisa.
- **06:07:54**: Fix handoff v4 doc/schema drift + regressions
  Aligned skill/usage docs with runtime v4 handoff contract, updated session schema catalog nextAction to typed string|object contract, and added regression tests for docs/help/schema/handoff json+json-min behavior.
- **06:07:55**: Refresh context docs for handoff v4
  Updated .agents/sdk-usage.md to reflect handoff_v2_required accepts --schema v2|v3|v4 and context-pack from-handoff supports v2|v3|v4 object nextAction payloads.
