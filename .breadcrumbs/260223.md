# Breadcrumbs 2026-02-23

- **00:26:24** (`skills/lisa/SKILL.md`): Audit Lisa skill contracts vs CLI
  Executed broad ./lisa matrix on isolated tmux socket, including nested detection phrasing and 4-level smoke with codex-spark; documented observed JSON/exit nuances.
- **00:26:25** (`skills/lisa/data/commands.md`): Clarify Lisa command contracts
  Updated skill docs with cursor-file hard-error requirements, bounded monitor guidance, list json-min shape notes, smoke report-min omissions, and success payload shape caveats for checkpoint/dedupe/aggregate.
- **00:27:49** (`skills/lisa/data/commands.md`): Clarify skills install args
  Documented skills install argument names: --to, --project-path, --path, --repo-root; prevents unknown-flag mistakes.
- **00:28:42** (`skills/lisa/SKILL.md`): Reapply skill clarifications after sync
  skills sync test rewrote repo skill files; reapplied SKILL and validation clarifications for cursor-file guardrails, monitor timeout hygiene, and report-min payload caveats.
- **00:30:08** (`skills/lisa/data/commands.md`): Expand command output-shape notes
  Added route runbook object shape, prompt-lint warnings schema, cursor-file hard-error semantics, tree delta-json flags, and smoke report-min payload caveat.
- **00:56:18**: Completed feature implementation + contract sync
  Finished all requested feature ideas: added session contract-check, monitor timeout-seconds, prompt-lint strict, aggregate dedupe, route profile, handoff compress, explain since cursor, list watch-json stream, smoke export artifacts, skills doctor contract-check; aligned help/capabilities/tests; gofmt + go test ./... green.
- **00:58:06**: Closed contract drift end-to-end
  session contract-check now passes in repo docs; skills install synced repo skill into ~/.codex/skills/lisa and ~/.claude/skills/lisa; skills doctor --contract-check now reports both targets up_to_date.
- **01:07:02**: Add review-driven help/capabilities/skills-doctor tests
  Added negative help route, capabilities help+unknown-flag text-path tests, and skills doctor missing_flag_value + contract-check missingFlags coverage in owned test files.
- **01:52:32**: Fix watch-json contract + docs parity
  Fixed session list watch-json to always enforce --json-min; aligned help default watch interval to 2s; synced skill command docs for monitor/event flags and extended command flag surfaces; added regression tests for watch-json, handoff compress, smoke export, route profile, and active-only list filtering.
- **02:42:37**: lisa skill validation + docs hardening
  Ran exhaustive ./lisa command matrix (session/oauth/skills/smoke/autopilot/nested triggers) on isolated socket; updated skills/lisa/SKILL.md + data/validation.md + data/feature-ideas.md with verified contract notes, webhook/guard/chaos-report edge behavior, and scored proposed context-optimization features.
- **02:42:42**: context refresh completed
  Synced Lisa skill guidance with validated runtime behavior and appended proposed LLM-focused feature backlog with impact scoring.
